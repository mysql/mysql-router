/** @class MySQLRoutering
 *  @brief Manage Connections from clients to MySQL servers
 *
 *  The class MySQLRouter is used to start a service listening on a particular
 *  TCP port for incoming MySQL Client connection and route these to a MySQL
 *  Server.
 *
 *  Conenction routing will not analyze or parse any MySQL package nor will
 *  it do any authentication. It will not handle errors from the MySQL server
 *  and not automatically recover. The client communicate through MySQL Router
 *  just like it would directly connecting.
 *
 *  The MySQL Server is chosen from a given list of hosts or IP addresses
 *  (with or without TCP port) based on the the mode. For example, mode
 *  read-only will go through the list of servers in a round-robin way. The
 *  mode read-write will always go through the list from the beginning and
 *  failover to the next available.
 *
 *
 *  Example usage: bind to all IP addresses and use TCP Port 7001
 *
 *   MySQLRouting r(routing::AccessMode::kReadWrite, "0.0.0.0", 7001);
 *   r.destination_connect_timeout = 1;
 *   r.set_destinations_from_csv("10.0.10.5;10.0.11.6");
 *   r.start();
 *
 *  The above example will, when MySQL running on 10.0.10.5 is not available,
 *  use 10.0.11.6 to setup the connection routing.
 *
